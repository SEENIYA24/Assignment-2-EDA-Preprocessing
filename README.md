# Assignment-2-EDA-Preprocessing
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing and visualizing a dataset to uncover insights, patterns, anomalies, and relationships within the data.
Findings and Conclusions: EDA and Preprocessing

After completing the exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing steps, we can summarize the insights, findings, and the outcomes of the preprocessing tasks. This helps assess the quality of the data and prepare it for modeling effectively.
1. Data Exploration

    Summary Statistics: Initial statistical analysis provided insights into the distribution, central tendencies, and spread of each feature. This step helped in identifying outliers and unusual patterns in the data.
    Unique Values and Data Types: Identifying the unique values in each categorical column helped in understanding the categorical data and guided decisions on encoding methods.
    Column Renaming: Renaming columns improved the readability of the data and ensured consistent naming conventions for easier referencing.

2. Data Cleaning

    Handling Missing Values:
        Missing values were treated using various techniques, such as mean/median/mode imputation or removal, depending on the nature of each feature.
        For example, age values equal to 0 were replaced with NaN, and then handled by imputing with a reasonable value, such as the median age.
    Duplicate Removal: Removing duplicates improved data integrity, ensuring there were no repeated records, which could skew analysis or model training.
    Outlier Detection and Treatment:
        Outliers were detected through visual methods (e.g., box plots) and statistical approaches (e.g., IQR method).
        Depending on the context, outliers were either removed or kept if they represented meaningful information.

3. Data Analysis

    Filtering and Segmentation:
        Filtering data based on conditions (e.g., age > 40 and salary < 5000) helped focus the analysis on particular subsets.
        This filtering allowed for focused insights into demographic segments, which could aid in decision-making or targeted modeling.
    Visualizations:
        Scatter plots for age vs. salary provided insights into potential correlations and trends.
        Bar plots of the count of people by location or other categorical variables helped in understanding distribution across different segments.

4. Data Encoding

    One-Hot Encoding: For categorical columns with fewer unique values, one-hot encoding was applied. This allowed categorical features to be represented in a format suitable for most machine learning algorithms, without adding too many new columns.
    Label Encoding: For columns with a high number of unique categories, label encoding was applied to avoid a high-dimensional dataset. This helped manage dimensionality while retaining categorical distinctions.
    Encoding Strategy: The choice of encoding method was determined by the number of unique values in each categorical feature, providing a balance between model interpretability and dimensionality.

5. Feature Scaling

    Standardization: StandardScaler was applied to ensure features had a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps algorithms sensitive to feature scales (e.g., SVM, K-Means) perform optimally.
    Normalization: MinMaxScaler was used to bring features within a 0-1 range. This approach is particularly useful for models that require bounded input, such as neural networks or distance-based algorithms.

   Conclusion

The EDA and preprocessing pipeline transformed raw data into a refined, structured format ready for modeling. This included:

    Removing irrelevant and noisy data (e.g., duplicates, unnecessary columns).
    Imputing missing values and treating outliers to prevent skewed analyses.
    Encoding categorical data and scaling numerical features to ensure compatibility with various machine learning algorithms.

By implementing these preprocessing steps, the dataset's quality, consistency, and usability have been significantly improved, creating a solid foundation for successful machine learning model training and improved prediction accuracy.
